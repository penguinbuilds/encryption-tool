A simple CLI based encryption tool built using Python.

This tool can be used to encrypt files and directories. In case of directories, they are first archived, and then encrypted.
A `.obscured` file is generated by the tool upon successful encryption. This can then be decrypted using the tool.

To encrypt:
`obscure <file/directory>`

To decrypt:
`reveal <filename>.obscured`

Upon decryption, the original extension is restored.
